# ESLZ (Enterprise Scale Landing Zone) launchpad blueprint

## Description

This level 0 blueprint will deploy the required launchpad in support the ESLZ.

The following resources will be deployed by this blueprint:

1. Azure Active Directory Security Groups for level0-rover-developers
2. Launchpad enterprise application
3. Launchpad resourcegroup
4. Launchpad keyvault for terraform secrets
5. Launchpad Log Analytics Workspace and KeyVaultAnalytics solutions
6. Launchpad Storage Account for terraform state
7. Launchpad Storage Account for diagnostic logs

## Deployment

1. Launch the development workspace in a container following the instructions found at: https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones/blob/master/documentation/getting_started/getting_started.md

2. Copy the sample.tfvars file located in the `environments` folder and name it in a similar was as you did in step 0. For enample, for a `dev` environment you will name the file `dev.tfvars`. Update the `<env>.tfvars` file with the desired variables value. See the [README.md](../envvars/README.md) file in the folder for more information.

2. If not already logged-in:

```
rover login
```

4. Install the subscription launchpad. For example, to install the launchpad in a `dev` subscription do:

```
cd L0_blueprint_launchpad
gorover dev apply
```

## Managing access to the launchpad

If you want to allow more than one user to deploy code based on this launchpad you will need to add them as members of the Azure Active Directory security group that was created as part of the `L0_blueprint_launchpad` deployment.

This membership assignment is handles in the L1_blueprint_base deployment. Simply add any user login email address as found in Azure Active Directory to the desired `<environment>.tfvar` file located in the `L1_blueprint_base/environments` folder. You will list toes identitied in the `L1_RBAC` variable object definition under the `ownerNames` list. For example:

```json
L1_RBAC = {
  ownerNames = [
    "user1.name@111dev.onmicrosoft.com",
    "user1.name@111dev.onmicrosoft.com"
  ]

  contributorNames = []

  readerNames = []
}
```

You can add as many as you need. You can also remove them when needed and simple re-run the `rover-<environment>.sh` script to update the membership.
